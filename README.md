## What is Exploratory Data Analysis?

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a technique used to gain insights and understanding from a given dataset. It is an approach for analyzing and summarizing data that allows analysts to identify patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. EDA is typically the first step in the data analysis process and also is an iterative process that involves visualizing and summarizing the data in various ways.

The main goal of EDA is to develop a deeper understanding of the data and identify any potential issue or limitation. This process allows analysts to clean and prepare the data for further analysis, and can also reveal insights that can guide the analysis to move in a proper direction.

## The Task:
The World Cup 2023 Data Analysis project aims to delve into the cricketing world, specifically focusing
on the performance of teams and players during the prestigious tournament. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and notable statistics that provide a delicate understanding of team
and player performance. The analysis should encompass both batting and bowling aspects, considering
key metrics such as runs, wickets, strike rate, economy rate, and other relevant factors.
